# st2195_assignment_1

**Practice Assignment 01**

_DISCLAIMER : This is my first time doing this so please excuse my mistakes_

1. To start of this assignment, first we have to create a Github repository named "**st2195_assignment_1**".
2. Next is to code a short markdown description of this assignment onto a **readme.md file**. This is the first commit to the repository.
3. Then we'll have to create a new R-studio project which has to contain an R script that will print **all** the integers from 1 to 10 _inclusive_.
4. Repeat 3 with Python on Spyder instead of R on R-studio.
5. Generate HTML files of the R markdown file and Jupyter notebook and place them in their respective folders.
